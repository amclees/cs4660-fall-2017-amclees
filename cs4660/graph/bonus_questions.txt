Let V be the number of nodes
Let E be the number of edges

Construct graph from file O(V + E * lg(V))
==========================================

Reading the node count takes O(1) since it is always one line.

Reading the edges from the file take O(E * lg(V)) since there are E lines that
increase based on the digits used to represent the node numbers.

Adding V nodes to the graph takes O(V) time since creating of a linked list
and added an entry to a dictionary both take O(1).

Adding E edges to the graph takes O(E * lg(V)) time because splitting and parsing
numbers each take O(lg(V)) time (length of each line increases with the digits used
to represent V, digits increase O(lg(V))).
